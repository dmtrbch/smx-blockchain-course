<h2 id="growth-mindset">Growth Mindset</h2>
<p>First and foremost, foster a growth mindset and take full advantage of the course. Understanding takes time. There will be struggles and frustration when learning something new, especially something as difficult as blockchain development.</p>
<p>Fortunately, enrolling in a continuing education course such as this indicates that you already exhibit a growth mindset. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2ar6AKvGc">Here is a short video</a> that shows the differences and talks about how you can demonstrate a growth mindset throughout this course.</p>
<h2 id="ask-all-the-questions">Ask All the Questions</h2>
<p>There is a common myth about the "all-knowing" developer who never needs to ask any questions. This person simply does not exist.</p>
<p>Developers of all skill-levels need to ask questions! All developers use a search engine to find what they need. Do not hesitate to do these things!</p>
<p>As you're going through the course, we recommend you take some time to write down a question about something you learned. Then, take time during the next week to answer that question. On the following Friday, make sure you've answered your question(s) and write another.</p>
<h2 id="give-yourself-time-to-understand">Give Yourself Time to Understand</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to learn these concepts by hearing them once. Instead, you’ll hear concepts multiple times and begin to learn more each time around. Maybe you’ll start programming and it makes some more sense. Finally, you’ll try to explain it to someone and realize there’s a part you don’t understand, which you then have to go back and learn. </p>
<p>This is the process of learning blockchain, and if you can accept it, it will take the pressure off trying to perfectly understand something the first time you hear it. Instead, try to let it wash over you, ask questions when they come up, but we’re also going to dive into the unknown, pull you up to catch breath, then do it again!</p>
<p>Always keep in mind, if you find yourself truly stuck and need assistance, post a question into the relevant course chat and I will for sure try to assist. We are all here to learn and grow.</p>
